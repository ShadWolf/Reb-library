REBOL Library

Rebol library contains for the most part the script I worked on from 2000 to 2010 
while participating to the rebol community.

Authors had been kept in the credit as mutch as I could remember.


Licence are there is no licence and franckly I doubt you will never retake those work in your account.

If you want your scripts to be hosted here there is absolutly no problems. E-mail me.

My rebol v3 intent to reboot project is to make those glorious rebol scripts work 100% with rebol v3.

Rebol Community along the years had done some pretty amazing piece of coding. By setting up this repository
and setting as my goal to have those script fully working with REBOL v3 I hope to address a thank you to 
the Rebol community.
